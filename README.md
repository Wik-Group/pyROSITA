## Installation

``pyROS`` is currently in a **pre-release** stage of development. If you'd like to use this package, you'll need to install it directly from the git repository. To do so,

```
>>> git clone https://www.github.com/WikGroup/pyROS
```
Once the clone of the repository has been generated, navigate into the ``/pyROS/`` module directory and run

```
